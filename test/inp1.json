  "question":"You recently visited a dog park and were disturbed by the lack of control the owners\nimposed on their dogs, making them dangerous for everyone around.\n\nWrite an email to your local municipality in about 150-200\nwords. Your email should include the following things:\n• Describe the situation\n• Explain why the dogs were a danger to others\n• Propose a solution",
  "answer": "Dear local municipality,\nThe main purpose of my writing today is to lodge a complaint about the dog park in our town, that I visited with my family last weekend.\nTo begin with, I was playing with my kids when a gigantic dog without a leash\nsuddenly appeared behind my back. \nMy kids were very scared by this aggressive barking creature and started crying.\nIt's very important to respect the rules of each other in our society. \nBig creatures like this dog, walking around the park without control, may be not only a source of danger but also a cause of various viruses for humans.\nBased on what I have provided you today, I may suggest a few options to solve this problem. \nFirstly, I would strongly recommend increasing the amount of penalty for breaking the rules in our park. Furthermore, it will be a good idea to move the dog park far away from the children's playground.\nI am looking forward to seeing how my suggestions translate to prompt actions from your side.\nYour kind cooperation would be most appreciated.\nSincerely,\nAlexey Ivanov"

{"band": "6", "comment": "The response is generally well-organized and addresses the task requirements. The candidate provides a clear description of the situation and explains why the dogs were a danger to others. Additionally, the candidate proposes a solution. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved.\n\nFirstly, while the candidate provides some details about the incident, more specific information could be included to make the situation more vivid and compelling. Additionally, the candidate could have expanded on the potential dangers and risks posed by uncontrolled dogs in a public park, such as physical injuries or the spread of diseases.\n\nSecondly, the candidate's solution is somewhat limited. While suggesting an increase in penalty for rule-breaking is a valid suggestion, more comprehensive measures could have been proposed, such as requiring mandatory training for dog owners or establishing stricter leash regulations.\n\nOverall, the response meets most of the criteria for Task Achievement, but could benefit from further development and elaboration of ideas.")}
