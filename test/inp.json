  "question":"You recently visited a dog park and were disturbed by the lack of control the owners\nimposed on their dogs, making them dangerous for everyone around.\n\nWrite an email to your local municipality in about 150-200\nwords. Your email should include the following things:\n• Describe the situation\n• Explain why the dogs were a danger to others\n• Propose a solution",
  "answer": "Dear local municipality,\nThe main purpose of my writing today is to lodge a complaint about the dog park in our town, that I visited with my family last weekend.\nTo begin with, I was playing with my kids when a gigantic dog without a leash\nsuddenly appeared behind my back. \nMy kids were very scared by this aggressive barking creature and started crying.\nIt's very important to respect the rules of each other in our society. \nBig creatures like this dog, walking around the park without control, may be not only a source of danger but also a cause of various viruses for humans.\nBased on what I have provided you today, I may suggest a few options to solve this problem. \nFirstly, I would strongly recommend increasing the amount of penalty for breaking the rules in our park. Furthermore, it will be a good idea to move the dog park far away from the children's playground.\nI am looking forward to seeing how my suggestions translate to prompt actions from your side.\nYour kind cooperation would be most appreciated.\nSincerely,\nAlexey Ivanov",
